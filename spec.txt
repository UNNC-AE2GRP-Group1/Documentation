1 Introduction

1.1 Project Identification


1.2 Purpose

This Software Requirement Specification (SRS) identifies the requirements and specification for the software of this project. It explains the functional features of the animation together with design, interface details and other considerations.

1.3 Scope

 

1.4 Overview

The rest of the SRS presents the specifications of the software in detail. Section 2 of the SRS is the overall descriptions of the software and its functional requirements. Section 3 outlines other related non-functional requirements of the software.

 

2 Overall Descriptions

This section specifies the software platform and functional requirements including core features and optional features.

 

2.1 Product Perspectives

The software is an web based product intended for use on Linux and mobile phone.

 

2.2 Product Functions

The list provides a description of main functional features. These features are divided to two categories: core features and optional features. Core features are essential to the operation of the application, and optional features are additional functionalities.

2.2.1 Core features

[1] Conceptual Entities

(1) Module

A module represents a course in the university.

- Module information

A module contains a name, a code, an academic year, one or more module conveners, zero or more teaching assistants, and an student list.

- Module creation

A module must created by an administrator. The name, code, and academic year are required to create a module.

- Updating module information

After the creation, an administrator may modify the information of the module, such as assigning module convenors. (Who will assign the teaching assistants?)

- Student list

The student list is a set student records, including all students once enrolled in the module, with an indicator of the enrollment status, which can be enrolled or exited. (Q1. if two module have the same students, should the system maintain two different records of the students, or reference to a single one? if use the latter strategy, which record should be considered as authoritative?) Each student record contains a studnet ID, a first name, a family name, a degree name, a gender, and an email address.

Any convenor of the module, or administrator, may edit the student list. The student list may be imported from a csv file, ("data source") (format undecided), or manually edited.

The system should provide a mechanism for adapting to differently data source.

The student records imported from the file should be merged with the existing information. Before the imported data affect the system, a detailed list of affected student records, including newly enrolled students, students present in the system but not in the data source, students in both the system and the data source, but their information conflicts, should be provided to the user.

A student may be added to or removed from the student list, or marked as exited with an exit date. The removal function is only for removing incorrect information from the list, and should issue a warning before proceed.

- Module archive

When a module is finished, an administrator may archive the module, hereafter no information of the module may be changed, and no session of the module may be created. (need review)

(2) Session

A session belongs to a module. It represents a particular event of a module that requires an attendance record.

- Session information

A session contains a reference to its module, a time, a place, an attendance record, and optionally a type which can be lab, lecture, or customized text.

- Creating a session

A session of a module must be manually created by a convenor of the module. During the creation of a session, an exact copy of the student list of the module is created as an empty attendance record, with extra fields, including an attendance status and a reference to an absent form series.

- Physical attendance sheet

After the creation of a session, the module convenor, or any lab assistant assigned to the module, may obtain a printable document of an attendance sheet containing a list of student ID and name of those from the aforementioned copy of currently enrolled student list and places for putting their signatures. That document may be obtained as many times as needed.

- Attendance record

The students in the attendance record can be edited by the module convenor as for the student list of the module.

- Recording attendance

A module convenor or teaching assistant can mark students absent in the attendance record. The module convenor can lock the attendance record so that only module convenors may modify it. A senior tutor may attach an absent form series to a student in the attendance record.

(3) Absent form series

An absent form series is a sequence of briefs of the absent form applications involved in an occasion of absence. Each brief contains a student name, a time, a responsible user, a comment, and an approval status which may be approved, rejected, or undecided. The series is independent of attendance records, but may be referenced by it.

- Creation

An absent form series must be created by a senior tutor. 

- Information control

The contents of the forms are secured offline. The system only tracks the existance and status of the forms, any handling of the actual forms are performed outside the system.

The comments can only be accessed by the responsible senior tutor.

(4) Role

Access to data is control by assigning permissions to objects to allow particular roles to access it, and assigning roles to users. For example, the convenors of a module forms a role, and the module object allows that role to read and write to it.

An object can have zero or more permissions, and a user can have zero or more roles.

Users are created by the administrator (integrate with LDAP if possible).

(5) Query

Users may make queries on the attendance records if they have sufficient permissions.

- Absences by module
- Absences by student
    (refer to Q1)
- Absences by week
- Absences by time range

(5) Summarized permissions

A = administrator
S = senior tutor
C = module convenor
T = teaching assistant
